# HelloFresh Dev Team - Mobile Developer Test

The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding skills.
​
Feel free to add at any point any particular technique or algorithm that you think might enrich the overall quality of the end result.
​
You're allowed and encouraged to use third party libraries, as long as you put them together yourself without relying on a framework to do it for you. An effective developer knows what to build and what to reuse, but also how his tools work. Be prepared to answer some questions about those packages.
​
There's no hard time limit, but we expect you to be able to solve this test in a few hours.
​
When you're finished, reply within the existing mail conversation that you have with jobs@hellofresh.de by attaching a zip file with your results.
​
​
## Requirements
​
* You MUST use Swift 2 for iOS apps. For Android, your app should be compatible with Android 4.2.
​
* You MUST name all labels, variable names, etc., in english.
​
* You MUST document your code.
​
* You CANNOT use app development frameworks (like cordova or others). But again, feel free to use any third party libs that might save you time.
​
* You SHOULD write tests.
​
​
## Exercise

Build an app in which:
​
* The content in the first screen is loaded dynamically from the [recipes.json](recipes.json) file attached.
​
* It has a login form for signing in with a valid email and a password.
​
* Each recipe can be marked as favorite/unfavorite
​
* Each recipe can be rated/unrated
​
* Of course since there's no server side component, the server requests will fail. This is expected.
However, client side validation before submitting forms MUST be implemented.
​
* You MUST implement a fluid layout, that adapts to any device _dimensions_ and _orientation_.
​
Good luck, and have fun!
